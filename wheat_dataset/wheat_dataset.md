# wheat_dataset

> Testing methods to account for genetic heterogeneity in genomic prediction using the wheat dataset
provided in the BGLR package.

[**1-test_w_bglr**](./scripts/1-test_w_bglr_literate/1-test_w_bglr.md) Loads BGLR, wheat dataset,
groups strains of wheat via PCA, and selects candidates from each group to serve as reference for
"breed/strain" composition estimation. Breed/strain composition estimates are intended to provide
additional information for breed prediction methods.
